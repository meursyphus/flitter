# Opacity

This widget motivated by Opacity in Flutter.

>A widget that makes its child partially transparent.
>
>This class paints its child into an intermediate buffer and then blends the child back into the scene partially transparent.
>
>For values of opacity other than 0.0 and 1.0, this class is relatively expensive because it requires painting the child into an intermediate buffer. For the value 0.0, the child is simply not painted at all. For the value 1.0, the child is painted immediately without an intermediate buffer.
