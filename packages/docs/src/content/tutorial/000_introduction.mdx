# Introduction

```bash
npm install @meursyphus/flitter
```

This example demonstrates how to render widgets using the `AppRunner` class. `AppRunner` is initialized with an SVG element as the `view` property, which is referenced through React's `useRef`. The widget is created using the `Container` function, which includes a `Text` widget as a child.

Within the `useEffect` hook, an `AppRunner` instance is created, and a resize event is set up through the `onMount` method. Afterwards, the `runApp` method is called to render the widget. When the component unmounts, the `dispose` method is called to clean up resources.

Through this process, the widget defined within the SVG element is rendered, and the layout is automatically updated according to screen size adjustments. This is handled by the `AppRunner`'s `handleViewResize` method.

Using the `@meursyphus/flitter` library in this way allows for declarative and reactive data visualization without complex DOM manipulation.
