# Column Row

The descriptions of each prop used in this example are as follows:
`Row` and `Container` widget prop descriptions:

`Row` widget props:

- `children`: This array defines the child widgets that will be included within the `Row`. Each child can be a `Flexible` widget.
- `mainAxis`: Defines the main axis of the `Row` widget, along which the child widgets will be arranged. It is horizontal by default.
- `crossAxis`: Defines the cross axis of the `Row` widget, determining how the child widgets will be aligned along this axis. For example, `crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center` positions the children at the center of the cross axis.

`Column` widget props:

- `children`: This array defines the child widgets that will be included within the `Column`. Each child can be a `Flexible` widget.
- `mainAxis`: Defines the main axis of the `Column` widget, along which the child widgets will be arranged. It is vertical by default.
- `crossAxis`: Defines the cross axis of the `Column` widget, determining how the child widgets will be aligned along this axis. For example, `crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center` positions the children at the center of the cross axis.

`Flexible` widget props:

- `flex`: Defines the proportion of space this widget will occupy within the `Row`. For example, `flex: 1` indicates a size relative to other `flex` values.
- `child`: The child element to be included within the `Flexible`, typically a `Container`.

Layout description:

- The first `Row` contains two `Container` children, each with a background color of red and blue respectively, and dimensions of 200x100.
- The second `Row` uses `Flexible` widgets to provide a flexible layout. The first `Flexible` has a `flex: 1` value, and the second has a `flex: 2` value. This means the second container occupies twice the space of the first. Each contains a container with heights of 100 and backgrounds of green and purple respectively.

This configuration allows users to flexibly arrange containers of various sizes and colors, and easily adjust text alignment.
