# Installing Flitter

This guide will walk you through the process of installing Flitter in your project. Flitter can be used in various JavaScript environments, including pure JavaScript, React, and Svelte.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

## Installation Steps

### For Pure JavaScript Projects

1. Create a new directory for your project (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   mkdir my-flitter-project
   cd my-flitter-project
   ```

2. Initialize a new npm project:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

3. Install Flitter:
   ```bash
   npm install @meursyphus/flitter
   ```

### For React Projects (using Vite)

1. Create a new Vite project with React template:

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest my-flitter-react-app -- --template react-ts
   cd my-flitter-react-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install Flitter and its React bindings:
   ```bash
   npm install @meursyphus/flitter @meursyphus/flitter-react
   ```

### For Svelte Projects (using SvelteKit)

1. Create a new SvelteKit project:

   ```bash
   npm create svelte@latest my-flitter-svelte-app
   cd my-flitter-svelte-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install Flitter and its Svelte bindings:
   ```bash
   npm install @meursyphus/flitter @meursyphus/flitter-svelte
   ```

## Verifying the Installation

After installation, you can verify that Flitter is correctly installed by checking your `package.json` for the Flitter dependencies.

In the next section, we'll guide you through creating your first Flitter app to ensure everything is set up correctly.
