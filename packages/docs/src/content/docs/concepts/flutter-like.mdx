# Flutter-like Structure in Flitter

Flitter is designed to closely mirror the structure and principles of Flutter, bringing the power and simplicity of Flutter's declarative UI paradigm to web-based data visualization. This section explores how Flitter adopts Flutter's structure and the benefits it brings to developers.

## Key Similarities with Flutter

1. **Widget-based Architecture**: Like Flutter, everything in Flitter is a widget. This consistent approach simplifies UI construction and promotes reusability.

2. **Declarative UI**: Flitter uses a declarative style to build UIs, making it easier to understand and predict how the UI will look based on the current state.

3. **Composition over Inheritance**: Flitter encourages composing complex UIs from simpler widgets rather than relying heavily on class inheritance.

4. **Immutable Widget Properties**: Once created, widget properties in Flitter are immutable, promoting a unidirectional data flow.

5. **State Management**: Flitter adopts Flutter's concepts of Stateless and Stateful widgets for managing UI state.

## Benefits of Flutter-like Structure

1. **Familiar for Flutter Developers**: Developers with Flutter experience can quickly adapt to Flitter, reducing the learning curve.

2. **Efficient Updates**: The immutable widget model allows for efficient UI updates by rebuilding only what's necessary.

3. **Predictable State Management**: Clear separation of stateless and stateful widgets makes state management more predictable and easier to reason about.

4. **Highly Customizable**: The composition-based approach allows for high levels of UI customization without complex inheritance hierarchies.

5. **Optimized for Data Visualization**: While maintaining Flutter's structure, Flitter is optimized for web-based data visualization tasks.

## Implementation in Flitter

Here's a simple example showing how Flitter implements Flutter-like structure:

```typescript
import {
  StatelessWidget,
  StatefulWidget,
  State,
  Container,
  Column,
  Text,
  TextStyle,
  Colors,
  GestureDetector,
} from "@meursyphus/flitter";

// A stateless widget
class Header extends StatelessWidget {
  private title: string;

  constructor(title: string) {
    super();
    this.title = title;
  }

  build() {
    return Container({
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
      color: Colors.blue[500],
      child: Text(this.title, {
        style: new TextStyle({ color: Colors.white, fontSize: 24 }),
      }),
    });
  }
}

// A stateful widget
class Counter extends StatefulWidget {
  createState() {
    return new CounterState();
  }
}

class CounterState extends State<Counter> {
  private count: number = 0;

  incrementCounter() {
    this.setState(() => {
      this.count++;
    });
  }

  build() {
    return Column({
      children: [
        new Header("Flutter-like Counter"),
        Container({
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
          child: Text(`Count: ${this.count}`, {
            style: new TextStyle({ fontSize: 18 }),
          }),
        }),
        GestureDetector({
          onClick: () => this.incrementCounter(),
          child: Container({
            padding: EdgeInsets.all(8),
            color: "green",
            child: Text("Increment", {
              style: new TextStyle({ color: Colors.white }),
            }),
          }),
        }),
      ],
    });
  }
}

// Usage
const myApp = new Counter();
```

This example demonstrates:

- Use of both Stateless (`Header`) and Stateful (`Counter`) widgets
- Composition of widgets to create the UI
- State management within a Stateful widget
- Event handling (tap gesture)

## Differences from Flutter

While Flitter closely mirrors Flutter's structure, there are some key differences:

1. **Web-First**: Flitter is designed specifically for web environments, unlike Flutter which is cross-platform.
2. **Rendering**: Flitter uses SVG or Canvas for rendering, optimized for data visualization tasks.
3. **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Flitter is written in and used with JavaScript/TypeScript, not Dart.
4. **Limited Widget Set**: Flitter focuses on widgets useful for data visualization, and may not include all widgets found in Flutter.

## Conclusion

By adopting a Flutter-like structure, Flitter brings the power and simplicity of Flutter's UI paradigm to web-based data visualization. This approach allows developers to create complex, interactive visualizations using a familiar, efficient, and highly customizable framework. As you continue to work with Flitter, you'll find that this structure enables you to create sophisticated data visualizations with ease and flexibility.
