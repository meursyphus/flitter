# Spacer

This widget motivated by Spacer in Flutter.

> Spacer creates an adjustable, empty spacer that can be used to tune the spacing between widgets in a Flex container, like Row or Column.
>
> The Spacer widget will take up any available space, so setting the Flex.mainAxisAlignment on a flex container that contains a Spacer to MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround, MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween, or MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly will not have any visible effect: the Spacer has taken up all of the additional space, therefore there is none left to redistribute.
