# FractionalTranslation

This widget motivated by FractionalTranslation in Flutter.

> Applies a translation transformation before painting its child.
>
> The translation is expressed as a Offset scaled to the child's size. For example, an Offset with a dx of 0.25 will result in a horizontal translation of one quarter the width of the child.
>
> Hit tests will only be detected inside the bounds of the FractionalTranslation, even if the contents are offset such that they overflow.
>
> See: [https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FractionalTranslation-class.html](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FractionalTranslation-class.html)
