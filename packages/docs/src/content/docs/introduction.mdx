- **Framework Agnostic**: Use Flitter with your favorite JavaScript frameworks, including React, Svelte, and more.
- **Rich Widget Library**: Access a comprehensive library of pre-built SVG widgets that can be easily customized and extended.
- **Performance Optimized**: Enjoy smooth and fast rendering performance for even the most complex vector graphics.

## Getting Started

To get started with Flitter, install the library in your project:

```bash
npm install flitter-svg
