# Introduction

Flitter is a powerful framework inspired by Flutter, supporting both SVG and Canvas to create high-performance graphics and user interfaces. It is designed to easily implement complex data visualizations, interactive charts, diagrams, and graphic editors in web applications.

## Key Features

- **Render Object Tree**: Flitter uses a render object tree for efficient rendering, allowing easy management and manipulation of complex layouts.

- **Declarative Programming**: Following a declarative paradigm, the screen automatically updates when values change, simplifying application state management.

- **Optimized Rendering**: Re-rendering, painting, and layout recalculations are managed by the renderer pipeline, with optimizations applied to update only necessary parts.

- **Box Model Layout**: Users can easily compose layouts using the familiar Box model.

- **SVG and Canvas Support**: Supports both SVG and Canvas, meeting various graphic requirements. Developers can choose the appropriate renderer as needed.

- **Diverse Applications**: Can be utilized in various fields such as charts, diagrams, data visualization, and graphic editors.

## Showcase

Here are some examples of what you can create with Flitter:

This interactive ERD demonstrates Flitter's capability to create complex, interactive diagrams. Users can manipulate entities, add relationships, and visualize database structures in real-time. This showcase highlights Flitter's strengths in:

Creating responsive, draggable elements
Handling complex user interactions
Rendering intricate diagrams with ease
Real-time updates based on user input

## Why Flitter?

1. **Easy Learning Curve**: Uses syntax similar to Flutter, allowing mobile developers to easily adapt to the web environment.

2. **High Performance**: Handles complex graphics smoothly with an optimized rendering pipeline.

3. **Flexibility**: Abstracts SVG and Canvas manipulation, allowing developers to focus on business logic.

4. **Renderer Selection**: Can choose between SVG and Canvas renderers as needed, meeting various graphic requirements.

5. **Reusability**: Increases code reusability through a component-based approach.
