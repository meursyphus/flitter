# A controller for an animation.

This class lets you perform tasks such as:

Play an animation forward or in reverse, or stop an animation.
Set the animation to a specific value.
Define the upperBound and lowerBound values of an animation.
Create a fling animation effect using a physics simulation.
By default, an AnimationController linearly produces values that range from 0.0 to 1.0, during a given duration. The animation controller generates a new value whenever the device running your app is ready to display a new frame (typically, this rate is around 60 values per second).

This widget detect user interaction event like GestureDetector Widget in Flutter.
