## Props

### onClick
Type: (e: MouseEvent) => void | undefined
Defines a callback function that is executed when the component is clicked. This is useful for handling click events and performing actions like state updates or navigation.
### onMouseDown
Type: (e: MouseEvent) => void | undefined
Specifies a callback function that is called when the mouse button is pressed down over the component. It can be used to initiate drag operations or visual feedback.
### onMouseMove
Type: (e: MouseEvent) => void | undefined
Sets a callback function that is called when the mouse moves over the component. This can be useful for tracking mouse movement or implementing hover effects.
### onMouseUp
Type: (e: MouseEvent) => void | undefined
Provides a callback function that is called when the mouse button is released over the component. This can be used in conjunction with onMouseDown to implement click and release interactions.
### onMouseOver
Type: (e: MouseEvent) => void | undefined
Assigns a callback function that is executed when the mouse enters the component area. This is often used to change the appearance of the component to indicate that it can be interacted with.
### onMouseEnter
Type: (e: MouseEvent) => void | undefined
Defines a callback function that is called when the mouse pointer enters the boundary of the component. Similar to onMouseOver, but it is called only when the mouse first enters the component.
### onMouseLeave
Type: (e: MouseEvent) => void | undefined
Sets a callback function that is called when the mouse leaves the component area. This can be useful for resetting hover states or visual effects applied during mouse interaction.
### onDragStart
Type: (e: MouseEvent) => void | undefined
Specifies a callback function that is executed when a drag operation starts. This can be used to set up any state or visual elements needed for dragging.
### onDragMove
Type: (e: MouseEvent) => void | undefined
Provides a callback function that is continuously called when the mouse is dragged over the component. This can be useful for implementing drag and drop functionality.
### onDragEnd
Type: (e: MouseEvent) => void | undefined
Defines a callback function that is executed when a drag operation ends. This can be used to finalize the drag operation and clean up any temporary state or visual elements.
### onWheel
Type: (e: WheelEvent) => void | undefined
Sets a callback function that is called when the mouse wheel scrolls over the component. This can be used to implement custom scrolling or zooming functions.
### cursor
Type: Cursor | undefined
Specifies the style of the cursor when the mouse hovers over the component. This can be used to provide visual feedback on the interactivity of the component.
### child
Type: Widget | undefined
Defines the child widget that the GestureDetector wraps. This allows the GestureDetector to intercept events for its child widget.
### bubble
Type: Record\<EventType, boolean> | undefined
Controls event bubbling. This property determines whether events should propagate to parent components or be contained within the GestureDetector.
