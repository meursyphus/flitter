  "It’s the only data visualization library that supports both SVG and Canvas simultaneously. How cool is that?",
  "Adding interactions and animations is a breeze. Your charts will come to life!",
  "Ever tried adding mouse events to Canvas? It’s a nightmare, right? Flitter makes it simple.",
  "Developing charts with D3? Ugh, the layout calculations can be a real pain. With Flitter, it’s a walk in the park.",
  "Why use SVG? Because server-side rendering, debugging, and testing are so much easier. And guess what? Flitter supports SVG rendering too!",
  "But if performance is your top priority, no worries! You can render with Canvas using the same code. How awesome is that?",
  "Worried about performance issues in data visualization? Not with Flitter. It renders fast and efficiently.",
