        Flitter's syntax is highly similar to Flutter, making it intuitive for
        developers familiar with Flutter to create complex data visualizations
        with minimal additional learning. This seamless experience significantly
        reduces the development time and learning curve, allowing for quick
        adoption and productivity.

      <div
        class="self-stretch text-black text-base font-normal font-['Roboto'] leading-normal"
      >
        The library automates layout calculations, ensuring that visualizations
        are responsive and adapt seamlessly across different devices and screen
        sizes. This feature not only simplifies the development process but also
        enhances the user experience by making data visualizations more
        accessible and engaging across platforms.

        Utilizing SVG as its foundational technology allows Flitter to offer
        highly scalable, resolution-independent visualizations that can be
        easily rendered on the server side. This provides developers with the
        flexibility to create complex, interactive, and aesthetically pleasing
        visualizations that are also optimized for performance and compatibility
        across web environments.
