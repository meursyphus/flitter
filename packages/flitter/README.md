# Flutterjs

Flutterjs is a framework that deals with SVG.
Like React, it uses VDOM to manage state and optimize rendering,
and because the library calculates the layout directly,
it is much easier to visualize data than using D3.
This provides a high level of control and flexibility for data visualization.

(FlutterJs is a library inspired by Flutter, a cross-platform framework commonly used for mobile app development.)
